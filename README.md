# Basic-Student-Attendance-Using-Barcode-System
An android app for scanning Barcodes (Preferrably QR Code) that records time and other basic inputs. WORK IN PROGRESS. Developed using Zebra Crossing Library.

Planned Features:

- Local Data Save using SQLite (+++)
- Online Data Sync using suitable tools; considering the use of Firebase (+++)
- Data convertibility to Spreadsheets (.xlsx) (++)
- Custom-generated QR Code (++)
